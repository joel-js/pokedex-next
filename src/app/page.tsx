        Welcome to PokeDex
      </h1>
      <p className="max-w-[750px] mx-auto leading-8">
        A Pokédex is an invaluable tool in the Pokémon universe, serving as an
        electronic device designed to catalog and provide information regarding
        the various species of Pokémon encountered by trainers during their
        adventures. Much like a digital encyclopedia, the Pokédex is capable of
        automatically recording data about Pokémon seen and caught, offering
        insights into their biology, behavior, and habitats. This fictional
        device is a cornerstone of Pokémon games and media, symbolizing the
        pursuit of knowledge and the progress trainers make in their journey to
        become Pokémon Masters. In the games, the completion of a Pokédex
        involves seeing and capturing a wide variety of Pokémon species,
        challenging trainers to explore diverse environments and engage in
        battles and trades to obtain rare and elusive creatures. The concept of
        the Pokédex extends beyond the games into other media, including the
        animated series, where it provides characters and viewers alike with
        crucial information about the Pokémon they encounter, enriching the lore
        and depth of the Pokémon world.
